# Eileen + Isabel Cohort 11 Google CSSI: Online Final Project

Welcome to our final Project!


## Bootleg-Pictionary

#### Game Play: 

  Select your role, "drawer" or "guesser."
  
  Each round is only 20 seconds, so be quick!
  
  Begin drawing on the canvas, or guessing the word based on the live illustration.
  
  Earn points by guessing the word correctly!
  
  After the preset number of words ends, the player with the most correct guesses (points) wins the game!
  

#### Building Bootleg Pictionary

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
- `public/script.js` and `public/timer.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`

On the back-end,

- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
